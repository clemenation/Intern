We're not an agency or web design company - so there are no horrific clients to answer to! Join us in our city centre studio with 180 degree views of hustle and bustle of city life! Your role will include building mobile apps, both from scratch and to fit in with our existing product portfolio (which mainly includes web apps right now). We're seeking someone who wants to learn and be given a great opportunity to excel in their role.
